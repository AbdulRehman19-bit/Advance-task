# Loan Default Risk with Business Cost Optimization

##  Objective
Predict the likelihood of a loan default and optimize decision-making based on business costs associated with false positives and false negatives.

##  Dataset
**Dataset Name**: Synthetic or real Home Credit Default Risk Dataset  
**Note**: If original dataset isn't available, synthetic data is used for demonstration.  
If using the real one, upload `application_train.csv` from [Home Credit Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data).

##  Steps Covered

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Generated synthetic data with binary target (loan default).
- Checked and removed null values.
- Split into train/test sets.

### 2. Modeling
- Trained **Logistic Regression** model (you can also try Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Used `StandardScaler` for normalization.

### 3. Business Cost Optimization
- Defined cost:
  - False Positive = \$500
  - False Negative = \$1000
- Found the best decision threshold that minimizes total business cost.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
- Cost curve vs threshold plot

### 5. Visualizations
- ROC Curve
- Cost Optimization Curve
- Final Confusion Matrix

##  Insights & Conclusion
- Optimized threshold: `~0.38`
- Model performance balanced to minimize financial loss
- Business-aware metrics can improve ROI over traditional metrics
